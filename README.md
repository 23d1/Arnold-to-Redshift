# Arnold-to-Redshift
Arnold to Redshift shader conversion script for Maya (based on the Arnold aiStandard to aiStandardSurface conversion script by Solid Angle).

Currently only supports aiStandardSurface to RsMaterial conversion, the plan is to implement most nodes as close to 1:1 as possible. Could use some help. ;)
